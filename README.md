# UW-Operating-System
## OS Project Using C language

Welcome to CS 537!

This course will introduce you to the the broad field of operating systems. Operating systems include a wide variety of functionality. 
This is an introductory course and topics we will cover include basic operating system structure, process and thread synchronization and concurrency, file systems and storage servers, memory management techniques, process scheduling and resource management, and virtualization.

The learning outcomes for this course are that at the end of the course you will be able to:

· Explain the fundamental types of operating system abstraction including processes, synchronization, virtual memory and persistence.

· Design and implement system libraries and kernel calls, which are mechanisms provided to user to access and develop new operating system functionality.

· Assess system performance and explain the impact of applying various algorithms and data structures to the complex operation of an operating system.
